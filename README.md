# Flutter Project 1
This is my first Flutter project. The goal of this project is to learn the basics of Flutter and build a simple mobile application. 


Well I am really new to Flutter and this project was purely learning based.


The learning project is orginally under codelabs-Code labs are online tutorials that provide developers with a hands-on learning experience by guiding them through the process of building a project step-by-step


So!!!


For those who really want to develop their very own Flutter app, can definitely follow this [link](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0).


The application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine" :sunglasses:.


The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. 


The app is responsive to different screen sizes.
